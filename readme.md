# Terminal Blues: A POWDER Tileset in CP437

![banner](extras/images/press_kit/embed-2x.png "Banner")

The Hacklike reimagined in a deep blue terminal aesthetic. Featuring:

- Terrain, monsters and items are entirely within Code Page 437
(/Extended ASCII/ANSI/etc.)[^1](#footnotes)
- (??? Heresy) Spell icons completely in 14px pixel-art
- Custom fonts: A very red Brass, plus two new fonts:
[Blightbulb](extras/lore/blightbulb.md) and [Eclipse](extras/lore/eclipse.md)!
- Questionable colourblind support

## Instructions

**Download latest release:**
[1.1.1](https://github.com/PropFeds/terminal-blues/releases/latest) (2020-09-27)

**Master:** Tileset is contained within `./export`.

Terminal Blues comes with a few **variants:**

- `blues`: The regular Terminal Blues experience.
- `true_blues`: The three Guardians of the True Blue, who attempt to aid those
with colour deficiencies. Please do give feedback.
  - `protea`: The guardian of the long cones (protanopia).
  - `deutzia`: The guardian of the medium cones (deuteranopia).
  - `tritoma`: The guardian of the short cones (tritanopia).

**Windows, Linux, Mac:**

- Create a `gfx/` subdirectory inside your POWDER installation, and move the
`.bmp`s of the desired variant there.
The `.bmp` files should be directly in `gfx/`, not in a subdirectory thereof.
- Optional features: Override in `gfx/` to apply.
  - `equipment`: Will display worn equipment on the @ tile.
  - `extra_alphabets` (Extra download): Rename desired alphabets to one of the
  regular alphabet names and override.
- Within POWDER, go to Options > Tiles > From Disk.
- To change the font, head to Options > Fonts.

**Nintendo DS:**

- Same instructions as above, to the `DATA/POWDER/gfx/` directory on the root
of your flash cartridge.
- On startup it should report detecting the tileset, and a new menu option
should show up.

**Gameboy Advance:**
From Jeff Lait,

> The splicebmp program was used to patch a POWDER ROM with these tiles.
> It is no longer supported. GBA users that want a new tileset need to recompile
> from scratch.

**Other Versions:**
You'll need to compile the game with this tileset included.
